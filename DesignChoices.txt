# This file will explain some of the design choices, especially on why some changes are made from the initial wireframe to the final design.
########################

Some of the designs in th wireframe were made before I realized that I should have started with smaller screen first. I then designed the
mobile wireframe around what I had for regular sized browsers. In addition, I did not realize all of the technical limitations during the
design process, and thus had to significantly change some of the design.

For the actual implementation, I did both mobile and desktop browser at the same where I would confirm that they both look good before moving on.
For when there would be too much / too little space, I split them into mobile and desktop only display.

# Background image
####################
I wanted something that looked good and kind kind of space related. I picked one that looked nice.
In hindsight the white/yellow on blue might have been a bad idea since the complenetary colors such as green against blue
feel a bit unprofessional. White text below a certain font size do kind of blend in with the stars.
I looked around a bit but did not really find anything that I feel is much better. I will have to research this topic more.

# 1. Home page
################

I am not too familiar with design, so I wanted something simple but aestatically pleasing.
I remember reading about how the eye naturally scans from upper left to bottom right.

And thus, I wanted to do a simple design with navigation on top left, welcome message a bit to the right of it, quick About Me snippet, and Quick Contact Info at the bottom.
I wanted something on top right to fill out the space to have something a bit more in the background.

I tried using container class and using columns to make the page responsive, and positioning the components quickly became a nightmare.
Positioning one thing breaks something else, and I decided that just having a centered welcome message looked good. I also decided not
to do the spherical image off on the side since the welcome message is now centered.

For the website background space came to mind, but for welcome message I wanted something clockwork and mechanical. The clockworks image I found looked nice.

From a philosophical perspective, I want my work to be the center stage and so I decided to
include featured project(s) instead of an About me snippet.
I removed the quick contact info section since it might clash with the featured projects section.

For the featured projects, I decided to show one project on smaller screen, and two on desktop browser.
It looked good so I implemented this.
In terms of the design choice for user to click on link to go to project page versus clicking on image on mobile:

a. Desktop site has two projets, and to have the image link directly to a position in carousel
would likely require Jquery or query parameters that I kind of want to avoid in a project focusing on HTML and CSS.

b. The display on mobile is smaller, where it is probably better user experience to have something large to press versus on desktop where user
can easily click on the link.

# 2. About Me page
#####################

I originally planned for two highlights below the large picture and quick bio, but since the Home page now has two featured projects, it is not needed here any more.

I have decided that I wanted something simple for this part.
I limited it to a selfie that is displayed as almost full container size on mobile with brief description, but 1/4 of the container on desktop with a longer description.

#####################
# 3. Projects page.
#####################

I originally wanted a lot of projects and have many display on screen at a time on Desktop, and just one displayed on mobile.
Since I wanted to focus on the HTML and CSS side, I kind of stuck to the basic Carousel features from Bootstrap of just one project displayed at a time.

I made all of the projects images the same size, but the different sized descriptions still caused the left and right srolling arrows to be at different heights.
This will have to be something that I come back to at the end.
I am looking into box-sizing, margin, padding and how those interact inside of a container.

In this case the desktop and mobile website looked pretty similar. Both ended up being kind of close to the mobile wire frame.

###############
# 4. Contact
###############

I originally wanted to do something with forms and multiple fields, but have decided to instead just do simple
hyperlinks to LinkedIn and github, and provide my email address.

For the planned interesting background images, I decided to go with something green since it complements blue.
I wanted to avoid something nature related, and so I ended up with some green lines.
The end result looked decent.
I scaled the three parts of the contact information differently for mobile and desktop.
