Portfolio Website Project

# Disclaimer:
# This is a project for making a portfolio website
This is not my official website, and is mainly for educational purposes of attempting to create
a professional looking portfolio website.

I will be trying to make it as professional as possible, but some aspects such as projects are
just place holders and not actual projects that I have done.
Since I am kind of a private person, I will probably not share actual contact information.

# I am going to use images from https://unsplash.com/ to make the website look better.
I do not own any of the images used, and will use very visible disclaimers when I use
those images as placeholders for projects that I have not actually done.

It is also probably a good idea to get into the habit of keeping track of where I got 
resources from. Going to keep track of that here.

1. Modified the image to be smaller and wider. Now called "gear_image_smaller.png"

2. Using this as the main background, renamed to "space_bg.jpg" since there seems to be issues
with anything with "-" in the file path.
