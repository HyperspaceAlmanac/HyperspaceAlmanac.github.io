Portfolio Website Project

# Disclaimer:
# This is a project for making a portfolio website
This is not my official website, and is mainly for educational purposes of attempting to create
a professional looking portfolio website.

I will be trying to make it as professional as possible, but some aspects such as projects are
just place holders and not actual projects that I have done.
Since I am kind of a private person, I will probably not share actual contact information.

# I am going to use images from https://unsplash.com/ to make the website look better.
I do not own any of the images used, and will use very visible disclaimers when I use
those images as placeholders for projects that I have not actually done.
