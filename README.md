Portfolio Website Project

# Disclaimer:
# This is a project for making a portfolio website
This website is mainly for educational purposes where it will have limited information
and is a snapshot of my progress. I will still try to keep it as professional as possible,
and keep on improving it.

Some aspects such as some of the projects are place holders (they will be labeled as such) so that I can
get more practice with website layout.
I will limit the contact information shared to places that already link to this github repo.

# Brief overiew
The wireframe files as well as the screenshots of them are saved to the "design" directory.
Mobile and desktop wireframe screenshots are saved separately, but they are in the same Adobe.xd file.
I have saved a DesignChoices.txt file into the same directory to explain some of the design choices
made and why I changed them in the actual implementation.

# I am going to use images from https://unsplash.com/ to make the website look better.
The images used from the website will be listed below with brief description of modifications done and what it is renamed to.
Most images will be scaled down a bit and set to fit certain dimensions.
I started with "-" but the file path is not recognized. I tried both "_" and camelCasing, and have decided to use
camelCasing for everything to keep it consistent.
