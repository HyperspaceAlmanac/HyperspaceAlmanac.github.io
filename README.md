Portfolio Website Project

# Disclaimer:
# This is a project for making a portfolio website
This is not my official website, and is mainly for educational purposes of attempting to create
a professional looking portfolio website.

I will be trying to make it as professional as possible, but some aspects such as projects are
just place holders and not actual projects that I have done (they will be labeled as such).
I will limit the contact information shared to places that already link to this github repo.

# I am going to use images from https://unsplash.com/ to make the website look better.
The images used from the website will be listed below with breif description of modifications done and what it is renamed to.
Most images will be scaled down a bit and set to fit certain dimensions.
I started with "-" but the file path is not recognized. I tried both "_" and camelCasing, and have decided to use
camel casing for everything ot keep it consistent.

1. Modified the image to be smaller and wider. Now called "gearImageSmaller.png"
